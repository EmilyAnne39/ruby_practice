For Hangman:

First we established the elements of the game:  how it is played and the types of classes we potentially needed.
*Remember to think through EVERY aspect of the game.
-The game has to start
-The game needs two players and a way to select a word
-The game needs a way to filter through letters to see if those letters match the word
-if they don't match, what happens?
-if they do match, what happens?
-the game needs a way to assign body parts when a letter is guesssed incorrectly
-the game needs a way to filter through those body parts
-if a word is guessed wrong, what happens to the body parts
-if a word is guessed correctly, what happens to the body parts?
-the game needs to display for the guessing player how many 'blanks' are left or filled
-the game needs to alert a player to keep guessing
-the game needs to determine how a player loses

Each of these scenarios needs a defined method that can be called when certain things happen within the game
